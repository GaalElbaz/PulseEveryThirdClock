PulseEveryThirdClock

This System-Verilog module implements a clock divider with a counter. Here's an overview of its purpose:

1. **Clock Divider Logic (always_ff block):**
   - The module has a 2-bit counter (`count`) that is incremented on each positive edge of the clock (`clk`).
   - If the reset signal (`rst`) is asserted, the counter is reset to `2'b00`, and the output (`out`) is set to `1'b0`.
   - The counter progresses through states `2'b00` -> `2'b01` -> `2'b10`. When it reaches `2'b10`, the output is set to `1'b1`, and the counter is reset to `2'b00`.

2. **Output Reset Logic (always_ff block):**
   - There is a second `always_ff` block triggered on the negative edge of the clock (`negedge clk`).
   - If the output is high (`out == 1'b1`) and the counter is in the `2'b00` state, the output is reset to `1'b0`.

3. **Monitoring (always_comb block):**
   - An `always_comb` block with a `$monitor` statement is included to display the value of `count` and the simulation time whenever `count` changes.

In summary, this module creates a clock divider that produces a pulse on its output (`out`) 
every third positive edge of the input clock (`clk`). The output pulse duration is one clock cycle. 
The monitoring block is used for simulation debugging, displaying the value of `count` and the simulation time whenever `count` changes.
